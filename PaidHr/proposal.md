## Security

- Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** using ASP.NET Core Identity.
- Secure APIs using **JWT bearer tokens** for authentication/authorization.
- Encrypt sensitive fields like salary and tax details â€” at rest (SQL encryption) and in transit (HTTPS).

## Availability

- Deploy to **Azure App Service** or AWS Fargate with **auto-scaling**.
- Use SQL Server **replication and failover** for DB high availability.
- Load balancers to distribute traffic during peak payroll periods.

## Reliability and Robustness

- Add **transaction management** when processing payroll to ensure atomic writes.
- Add **unit tests** and **integration tests** for all services (EmployeeService, PayrollService, etc).
- Run long-running payroll jobs on background workers (e.g., using Hangfire).

## Future Enhancements

- Add scheduled job support to auto-run payroll monthly.
- Support multiple salary types (hourly, monthly).
- Support international tax rules.
- Add UI for employees to submit/view leave and payslips.

## Conclusion

This initial architecture provides a solid, extensible foundation using .NET 8 and EF Core. With improvements to security, scaling, and reliability, it can support a full production payroll system.
